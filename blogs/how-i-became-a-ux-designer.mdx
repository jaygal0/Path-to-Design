If you ask every designer how they managed to find work or land a job in their respective fields, no one journey would look the same. Some designers would have taken the traditional route and found work immediately after their studies, others skipped education altogether, whilst others decided to switch to a totally different career.

In this article I want to share my story on how I managed to find work as a UX designer. Talk openly about the highs and lows, provide valuable advice, and give you hope that anyone can find work as a designer as long as you put the hard work in.

### The beginning

Having an older brother that studied graphic design and immediately found work after his studies, I naturally thought I was going to follow in his footsteps. I ended up going to the exact same university as he did, studied the same course and graduated with a BA Hons in Graphic and Media Design.

However, when it came to finding work after graduation, this was where our paths diverged.

Take note that my degree was centered around design, but it had nothing to do with UX as UX design wasn't a thing while I was studying. I'm not even sure if the term UX had been created back then. Gosh, I'm old!

### Taking the non-traditional route

Again, I'm probably showing my age, but around the time I graduated YouTube was relatively new at the time. Creators were making content on the platform and making a name for themselves, but it wasn't as saturated and full of content the way it is now.

It was around this time that a friend and I were consuming a lot of YouTube videos, and at the same time playing around with making videos ourselves. We could see the possibilites available to us, and after a brief conversation we decided to build something for ourselves on YouTube.

Knowing that we didn't want to be in front of the camera, we realised that we could still build a brand by being behind the cameras. This was when we came up with the idea of creating an online platform for unsigned musicians to showcase their talents.

### Building out our portfolio

Since nobody knew anything about our venture, we knew that we had to build everything from the ground up. We had to create a portfolio of videos showcasing artists in their best light.

Keep in mind that neither of us knew little to nothing about cameras, lights or editing a video. We truly faked it until we made it. While my friend was reaching out to potential artists and asking if we could record them, I had borrowed a camera from my dad and learned everything I could about shutter speed, aperature and ISO. Since we were recording artists, I had to figure out how to record the audio too!

Naturally, our first few videos were dismal (I'm my own worst critic), and I'm forever grateful for the artists that took the time to let us film them. As time went on, the more reps we put into our craft and the more videos we filmed, the better the production levels had become and the more people were taking notice of our channel.

Once we realised we could make something of it, my friend and I decided to try and take it all the way and become a legitimate business. [Reload Sessions Ltd](https://www.youtube.com/user/ReloadSessions) was born.

### Shutting it down

After 6 years of running the business, filming over 700 videos, travelling the world and amassing over 16,000,000 views. We decided to call it quits. The YouTube scene had become saturated and having to deal with competition as well as our personal lives changing, we could see the writing on the wall.

I always used to say that this was the biggest failure of my life as I was unable to grow it to the level I had hoped, but I don't take for granted the experience and life skills I had gained throughout the years.

Negotiating, public speaking, delegating, designing, editing, marketing, finance, legal, audio engineering, operating a camera, pitching business ideas and everything else it takes to build a company from scratch. I took it upon myself to learn all aspects of the business to try and make it work.

To this day, I use a lot of the skills that I gained from building my own business.

### Starting over in another country

I mentioned in our personal lives things had changed, it was around this time that I had decided to move to another country to live with my partner. Since we had shut down the business, it made sense to start off as a clean slate and start all over again.

Since I was in a new country, it made sense to find work rather than starting something new again. It would take too much time and I needed to settle into my new environment as quickly as possible.

The problem was, was that I had been self-employed for so long that I didn't know what it was like to be part of the workforce. I didn't know how to look for a job, what the interview process would be like, nor what field I wanted to get into. I just knew that I needed to secure a salary.

I was used to covering all aspects of the business that I found it weird to be able to focus on just one role. After some self-reflection, I decided that it would be best I focus on finding work in the field of design.

After all, I had graduated with a BA Hons in Graphic and Media Design. Plus, I had built and branded a company from the ground up. Although, it was my own business, it was still experience nonetheless.

### Finding my role as a UX designer

I knew I wanted to work in design and do something around technology. After a bit of searching across the job boards, I noticed a role that kept on popping up; UX designer. I must've been living under a rock while building my business, because I had no idea what the role entailed.

I had to educate myself all over again. I didn't have the time to go to school and learn the craft, plus if there's one thing that building my own business taught me, was that you could do anything if you put your mind to it.

In similar fashion to when I started my business, I had to understand what it took to be a UX designer and the more I read, the more I knew this was the role for me.

I treated it like a job, I would wake up and consume everything I could regarding UX design. I would watch YouTube videos, read books around the subject, trying to understand the workflows and the processes around the role.

### Building my UX portfolio

Similar to when I started my business we realised we needed a portfolio to be able to make a dent in the industry. This was no different, I couldn't find work as a UX designer with no portfolio to my name.

So I got to work.

I taught myself Figma (a tool to help you sketch out and create prototypes) and gave myself projects to help me build out my portfolio. It was around this time I was having the most fun, I was being creative and learning more about what it took to be a UX designer.

After weeks of building out the portfolio and just a few months of understanding the craft, it was time for me to start applying for jobs as a UX designer.

### Imposter syndrome was real

All throughout my time when building my business I had suffered from imposter syndrome. I would always second guess myself and wonder if I was good enough, I felt this even more when applying for jobs as a UX designer.

There were many no's and I was losing hope, but I kept on reminding myself that all it takes is one person to say "yes". After several failed interviews I finally managed to land a role as a UX designer for a IT design agency. From deciding to work as a UX designer to receiving that first yes, it took a total of three months.

Perhaps I got lucky, maybe my previous experience as a business owner more valuable than I had imagined or my mental fortitude shone through in the interview process. Whatever it was, I was able to land my first job as a UX designer.

### Anyone can do it

Now you might be reading this thinking to yourself, "There's no way I can recreate what you achieved!". What I want to remind you is that everyone else has their own journey. Yours might not look as extreme as mine, but if my journey shows you anything, it's that you really could do anything if you put your mind to it.

It'll take a lot of hard work, patience and resilience but if you keep at it and remain hopeful you could land a role in the design field. Whether it's a role similar to UX design or as an interior designer, keep at it and all your hard work will pay off.
